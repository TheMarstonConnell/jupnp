A first UPnP service and control point
:::

::: content
The most basic UPnP service imaginable is the *binary light*. This
device has one service, the power switch, turning the light on and off.
In fact, the *SwitchPower:1* service and the *BinaryLight:1* device are

In the following sections we\'ll implement this UPnP service and device
with the jUPnP Core library as a simple Java console application.
